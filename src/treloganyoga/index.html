					<li><div class="post-date">January, 16</div></li>
					<li><p>Working hard in my office now and processing tax returns for our clients I just had a thought that may be many of us can claim their tax back for this year. If you have paid tax through your wage and just started to work as a self-employed yoga teacher this financial year, you surely made a loss (very little income less all our tuition fees, books, props, mileage, etc). The idea is that you have to become a self-employed student yoga teacher and give a couple of lessons before 31 March 2010. Even if you don't work you can move the losses to the next year to offset against future income!</p></li>

					<li><div class="post-date">January, 25</div></li>
					<li><p>A century ago, Russia was the world leader in buckwheat production. Growing areas in the Russian Empire were estimated at 6.5 million acres , followed by those of France.In the north eastern United States, buckwheat was a common crop in the 18th and 19th centuries. Cultivation declined sharply in the 20th century due to the use of nitrogen fertilizer, to which maize and wheat respond strongly. Buckwheat groats are commonly used in western Asia and eastern Europe. The porridge was common, and is often considered the definitive peasant dish. It is made from roasted groats that are cooked with broth to a texture similar to rice or bulgur. The dish was brought to America by Russian and Polish immigrants who called it “kasha” and mixed it with pasta or used it as a filling for knishes and blintzes, and hence buckwheat groats are most commonly called kasha in America. The groats can also be sprouted and then eaten raw or cooked.</p></li>

					<li><div class="post-date">February, 21</div></li>
					<li><p>Onion is widely used in Russia to treat and prevent the flu. To prevent the flu: buy some onions, chop them and place in bowls around your home. If you work at a desk, place one or two in your office or under your desk or even on top somewhere. Try it and see what happens. If you have already got the flu: mince one large onion and place it in a cup. Place cup in a bowl with hot water. Make a cone using a paper, cover the cup with the larger part of the cone, insert small part of the cone into the nostril and breathe in through the nostril, breathe out through you mouth. Repeat 2 or 3 times, now make another cone and use it for the other nostril. You will cry, you will hate it! Take a rest and continue for 5-8 minutes, 2-3 procedures usually enough to kill all germs!</p></li>

					<li><a href="ask-for-forgiveness.html" class="post-title">Forgiveness</a></li>
					<li><div class="post-date">February, 21</div></li>
					<li><p>When you offer forgiveness, you can also say that what happened was wrong and that you will never allow it to happen again that you would even put your own body in the way of letting such harm come to another person in the future. But forgiveness is the act of not putting anyone out of your heart, even those who are acting out of deep ignorance or out of confusion and pain. Forgiveness is also a matter of letting go of the past and knowing that even though something was wrong, the way to go forward is to start over.It is also important to understand that the practice of forgiveness is a practice, which means you might do it 50 or 100 or more times before achieving an authentic sense of forgiveness in your heart. Some part of the process may involve rage and outrage, and some of it will probably involve grief and sorrow. Sometimes what arises in this process is that for the first time we fully come to understand how much anger we still carry and how deep our pain is</p></li>
