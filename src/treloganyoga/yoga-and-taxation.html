		<p>Working hard in my office now and processing tax returns for our clients I just had a thought that may be many of us can claim their tax back for this year. If you have paid tax through your wage and just started to work as a self-employed yoga teacher this financial year, you surely made a loss (very little income less all our tuition fees, books, props, mileage, etc). The idea is that you have to become a self-employed student yoga teacher and give a couple of lessons before 31 March 2010. Even if you don't work you can move the losses to the next year to offset against future income!</p>

		<p>Hope you find this information useful. Here is the link where you can <a href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/shortforms/form/CWF1ST?dept-name=CWF1&sub-dept-name&location=40&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hmrc.gov.uk">register</a>. And here you can <a href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kb5/hmrc/forms/view.page?record=yKpjabZqCc8&formid=433">search for specific forms</a>. Use form CF10 to apply for an exemption from Class 2 National Insurance contributions if you are self-employed and your net earnings from self-employment are below the relevant threshold.</p>

		<p>And if you just don't know where to start I will be happy to help you, I am an <a href="http://www.mycompacc.co.uk">accountant in North Wales and Flintshire area</a> and you can contact me for advice through our site.</p>
